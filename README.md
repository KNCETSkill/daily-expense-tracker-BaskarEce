Scenario Title: Daily Expense Tracker

As part of a personal finance app, you are building a module that helps users quickly calculate the total of two daily expenses â€” for example, travel and food expenses. This module will be reused frequently, so it must take two numbers as input and return their sum.

Your task is to create a program that reads two integer values representing expenses and prints their total.

ðŸ§ª Task Description
Write a C program that:

Reads two integers from input (representing two expenses).

Calculates the total.

Prints the result.

ðŸ§¾ Input Format
Two integers a and b, separated by a space.

ðŸ“¤ Output Format
A single integer: the sum of a and b.
